This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling. The `bug.js` file shows an API endpoint that fails to properly handle database errors and invalid user IDs, resulting in a generic error message for the client.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides an improved version with comprehensive error handling that sends informative error messages to the client and logs detailed error information for debugging.
